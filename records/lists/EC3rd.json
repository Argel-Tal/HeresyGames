all models in the unit must have the Deep Strike special rule and the unit must start the game in Reserve. When placing the unit in Reserve, you must tell your opponent that it will be arriving by Deep Strike (sometimes called Deep Strike Reserve). Some units must arrive by Deep Strike. They always begin the game in Reserve and always arrive by Deep Strike.\n\nArriving by Deep Strike\nRoll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves and then deploy them as follows:\n• First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model’s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing – it must continue to face the same direction as it did before you rolled for scatter.\n• Next, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit.\n• Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.\nIn the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one.\nUnits Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain.\nIn that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or Run, Turbo-boost or move Flat Out) as normal, and count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full Ballistic Skill.\nIn that turn’s Assault phase, however, these units cannot charge. This also applies to units that have disembarked from Transports that arrived by Deep Strike that turn.\n\nDeep Strike and Transports\nUnits do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.\n\nDeep Strike Mishaps\nDeep Striking onto a crowded battlefield can be dangerous, as one may miss the intended objective or even materialise inside solid rock! If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1\" of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.\n\n\nDeep Strike Mishap Table\nD6 - Effect\n1 - Terrible Accident! Teleporting units are lost in the Warp, deep striking jump units are shot down, or some other suitably dramatic event occurs.\nThe entire unit is destroyed!\n\n2-3 - Misplaced. The coordinates were inaccurate or the enemy has jammed your instruments.\nYour opponent may deploy the unit anywhere on the table (excluding impassable terrain, but including difficult terrain, which of course counts as dangerous for Deep Striking units), in a valid Deep Strike formation, but without rolling for scatter. Units embarked on a misplaced Transport can disembark during their Movement phase as normal.\n\n4-6 - Delayed. Because of mechanical failure or enemy action, the reinforcements are delayed.\nThe unit is placed in Ongoing Reserves.","id":"0f09-84c7-e224-4a86","name":"Deep Strike","hidden":false,"page":162},{"description":"Bulky models count as two models for the purposes of Transport Capacity.","id":"35e9-6bd8-f762-4692","name":"Bulky","hidden":false,"page":161},{"description":"Jump units can use their jump packs once each turn to move more swiftly in either the Movement phase or the Assault phase – they cannot use their jump packs in both phases in the same turn.

Note that the entire unit must always use the same form of movement. Units that are described as ‘moving like’ Jump units follow all of the rules for Jump units, and use the same special rules.\n\nSKYBORNE\nWhen using its jump pack (whether moving, charging or Falling Back, as we’ll discuss in a moment) a model can move over all other models and all terrain freely. However, if the model begins or ends its move in difficult terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test.\nJump models cannot end their move on top of other models and can only end their move on top of impassable terrain if it is actually possible to place the models on top of it. If they do this, however, they treat the impassable terrain as dangerous terrain.\n\nMOVEMENT PHASE\nIf a Jump model uses its jump pack (or equivalent) in the Movement phase, it can move up to 12\".\n\nASSAULT PHASE\nIf a Jump model uses its jump pack to charge into assault, it can re-roll its charge distance.\nFurthermore, to represent the crushing impact of such a charge, a model that uses its jump pack to charge gains the Hammer of Wrath special rule for the remainder of the turn.\n\nFALL BACK MOVES\nJump units always use their jump packs when Falling Back, and their Fall Back moves are 3D6\", even if they already used their jump pack to move that turn.\n\nSPECIAL RULES\nJump units have the Bulky and Deep Strike special rules.","id":"d52b-0af7-fe19-1ff0","name":"Jump Unit","hidden":false}],"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"Confers Jump Unit rules.","name":"Description","typeId":"4465736372697074696f6e23232344415441232323"}],"id":"07d7-4dd2-1484-2f06","name":"Jump Pack","hidden":false,"typeId":"57617267656172204974656d23232344415441232323","typeName":"Wargear Item"}],"id":"65b499b4b84c00d0eb0f1b3c","name":"Jump Packs","entryId":"9987-609f-8175-66b4::83eb-d202-365a-0e6a::bdb7-38c9-5aeb-fc05","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"entry"},{"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"Power armour provides a 3+ Armour save.","name":"Description","typeId":"4465736372697074696f6e23232344415441232323"}],"id":"0680-4dd1-54b3-1ed8","name":"Power Armour","hidden":false,"typeId":"57617267656172204974656d23232344415441232323","typeName":"Wargear Item"}],"id":"65b499b4b84c00d0eb0f1b40","name":"Power Armour","entryId":"9987-609f-8175-66b4::6077-1e2b-d3da-b3ce::0a96-04b6-7340-91a4","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"entry"},{"selections":[{"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"-","name":"Range","typeId":"52616e676523232344415441232323"},{"$text":"User","name":"Strength","typeId":"537472656e67746823232344415441232323"},{"$text":"-","name":"AP","typeId":"4.1502323234441545e+23"},{"$text":"Melee","name":"Type","typeId":"5.479706523232345e+27"}],"id":"e8ff-7994-f83f-1431","name":"Chainsword/Combat Blade","hidden":false,"typeId":"576561706f6e23232344415441232323","typeName":"Weapon"}],"id":"65b499b4b84c00d0eb0f1c2d","name":"Chainswords/Combat Blades","entryId":"9987-609f-8175-66b4::dd62-3711-c2c0-18a3::2b69-d5c2-a344-1e61::1087-66c1-c342-9cdc","entryGroupId":"9987-609f-8175-66b4::dd62-3711-c2c0-18a3::b11f-c58a-edd8-e10b","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"group","group":"Chainsword or Combat Blade"}],"id":"65b499b4b84c00d0eb0f1b44","name":"Chainsword or Combat Blade","entryId":"9987-609f-8175-66b4::dd62-3711-c2c0-18a3::10e739aa-3153-9348-3458-738dd5938617","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"entry"},{"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"Models with a Sonic Shrieker imposes a -1 WS penalty on enemy models in base contact in assault.

When placing the unit in Reserve, you must tell your opponent that it will be arriving by Deep Strike (sometimes called Deep Strike Reserve). Some units must arrive by Deep Strike. They always begin the game in Reserve and always arrive by Deep Strike.\n\nArriving by Deep Strike\nRoll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves and then deploy them as follows:\n• First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model’s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing – it must continue to face the same direction as it did before you rolled for scatter.\n• Next, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit.\n• Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.\nIn the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one.\nUnits Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain.\nIn that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or Run, Turbo-boost or move Flat Out) as normal, and count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full Ballistic Skill.\nIn that turn’s Assault phase, however, these units cannot charge. This also applies to units that have disembarked from Transports that arrived by Deep Strike that turn.\n\nDeep Strike and Transports\nUnits do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.\n\nDeep Strike Mishaps\nDeep Striking onto a crowded battlefield can be dangerous, as one may miss the intended objective or even materialise inside solid rock! If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1\" of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.\n\n\nDeep Strike Mishap Table\nD6 - Effect\n1 - Terrible Accident! Teleporting units are lost in the Warp, deep striking jump units are shot down, or some other suitably dramatic event occurs.\nThe entire unit is destroyed!\n\n2-3 - Misplaced. The coordinates were inaccurate or the enemy has jammed your instruments.\nYour opponent may deploy the unit anywhere on the table (excluding impassable terrain, but including difficult terrain, which of course counts as dangerous for Deep Striking units), in a valid Deep Strike formation, but without rolling for scatter. Units embarked on a misplaced Transport can disembark during their Movement phase as normal.\n\n4-6 - Delayed.

When placing the unit in Reserve, you must tell your opponent that it will be arriving by Deep Strike (sometimes called Deep Strike Reserve). Some units must arrive by Deep Strike. They always begin the game in Reserve and always arrive by Deep Strike.\n\nArriving by Deep Strike\nRoll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves and then deploy them as follows:\n• First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model’s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing – it must continue to face the same direction as it did before you rolled for scatter.\n• Next, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit.\n• Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.\nIn the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one.\nUnits Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain.\nIn that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or Run, Turbo-boost or move Flat Out) as normal, and count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full Ballistic Skill.\nIn that turn’s Assault phase, however, these units cannot charge. This also applies to units that have disembarked from Transports that arrived by Deep Strike that turn.\n\nDeep Strike and Transports\nUnits do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.\n\nDeep Strike Mishaps\nDeep Striking onto a crowded battlefield can be dangerous, as one may miss the intended objective or even materialise inside solid rock! If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1\" of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.\n\n\nDeep Strike Mishap Table\nD6 - Effect\n1 - Terrible Accident! Teleporting units are lost in the Warp, deep striking jump units are shot down, or some other suitably dramatic event occurs.\nThe entire unit is destroyed!\n\n2-3 - Misplaced. The coordinates were inaccurate or the enemy has jammed your instruments.\nYour opponent may deploy the unit anywhere on the table (excluding impassable terrain, but including difficult terrain, which of course counts as dangerous for Deep Striking units), in a valid Deep Strike formation, but without rolling for scatter.
